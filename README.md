What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?

There wasn't a lot of changes that I could make to this project...maybe just the color scheme.  However, I was able to go into figma and change the color of the design to make it stand out from other designs.  Not a HUGE deal, but I am proud that I made the change.

What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?

When converting from pixes to 'ems', some unexpected outcomes in which the font was to little or too small, or even when some of the widths became too small.  This happened within my '.published' and '.foundations' classes.  Here I just stuck with pixels, but made sure I tested the responsiveness to make sure everything was ok.

Another problem that I always tend to have in the beginning is centering the project on the page. I think I've gotten better with it, but it's always something that I get stuck on longer than I'd like. To overcome this, I usually just make the make the parent container a flex container, and center the content using the 'justify-content' and 'align-items' properties.

What specific areas of your project would you like help with?

I don't think that there is anything that I needed help with, but tips and comments are always useful. I don't think I had too many issues putting this project together, but any feedback to help me improve is always welcome!
